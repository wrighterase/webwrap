# Features

- Navigate in the file system as if you were in it, using `cd`
- You can use ``&&``, ``|``, everything you like
- Browse your commands history and re-use them (not really a feature, it uses `rlwrap`)

# Usage
Just replace your cmd field with "WRAP".

#### With the quick install :
```bash
$ webwrap http://<LINK>/my_verycool_webshell.php?cmd=WRAP
```
#### Not quick install :
```bash
$ rlwrap python3 webwrap.py http://<LINK>/my_verycool_webshell.php?cmd=WRAP
```
- Just remove the `rlwrap` from the command if you didn't install it.
- On Windows, remove `rlwrap` and replace `python3` by `py` or `python`.
